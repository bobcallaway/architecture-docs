# Scope

This document specifies the architecture of sigstore, an OpenSSF community and collection of projects which targets ubiquitous, transparent creation and verification of digital signatures of relevant artifacts within a software supply chain. It covers the following components:

* Rekor, a signature transparency log 
* Fulcio, a certificate authority issuing short-lived X509 code signing certificates based on Open ID Connect identity tokens
* Cosign, a signing and verification tool

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
