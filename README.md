# sigstore Architecture Documentation

The purpose of this repository is to store a community-edited, formal description of the architecture of sigstore. The architecture document may be submitted to a standards body (e.g. IETF) at some point in the future.

This repository was forked from [https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/), which provides many features to help in publishing.

## Development

These documents are currently (Sep. 2022) in a period of rapid iteration; as such, we're working on them in Google Docs before porting them to this repo. See the [landing page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OccxmZwkZZItrfOnO3RP8gku6nRbtJpth1mSW3U1Cc/edit) for details (you must be a member of the [sigstore-dev@ Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/sigstore-dev) to access). To participate, simply comment or suggest edits to the docs. Before making big changes, it's probably prudent to check in on the `#architecture-docs` channel in the [sigstore slack](https://sigstore.slack.com/) (invitation link [here](https://links.sigstore.dev/slack-invite)) or the "architecture docs" meetings (open to all community members) on the [sigstore community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZnE0a2dvbTJjZTQzaG5jbmJjZmphMmNrMjBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
